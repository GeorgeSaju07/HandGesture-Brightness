# HandGesture-Brightness
A Python-based hand gesture recognition system to dynamically control screen brightness using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Screen Brightness Control (SBC). The script detects the distance between the thumb and index finger to adjust brightness levels intuitively. Move fingers closer to decrease brightness and farther apart to increase it.
